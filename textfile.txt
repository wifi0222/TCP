Graduation is the time that you officially leave the home nest and start life on your own. Young people feel the need to work independently. In the professional world, independence means you're ready to be fully responsible for every assigned task at work. The boss counts on you. You can get help from colleagues, but it's down to you to ensure theassignment is completed. Independence also means you make your own choice or form your own opinion without being dependent on others.It means making sense of the world based on your own observations and experiences.
